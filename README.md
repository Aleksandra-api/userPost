API tests for user blog\

Dears, 

In the folder test you will find the tests that I created for https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/, according to the requeirements in the assigments. 
The tests are separated according to the type of the http methods for the request GET, POST and PUT. 
Also when you run all the test from the project the report is generated and you will be able to see results from the execution. 

I want to mention that all the post request are failing and is not passing, probably because they are not able real to create on the server or maybe has bugs with creating new posts and comments. 

Also the last test form PUT is failed because I thing that is a bug, because we are able to update the post with userId for which the postId is not existing.

I try to add my test in the circle ci tool, but I am not sure for which reason they are not building. I try to fix that but I didn't succed unfortunatly. 

Feel free to take a look on my solution and if you have further question I am here to discuss. 

Enjoy, 

Regards, 

Aleksandra
